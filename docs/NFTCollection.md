### safeTransferFrom

```solidity

```

_See {IERC721-safeTransferFrom}._

### _safeTransfer

```solidity
function _safeTransfer(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId, bytes data) internal virtual
```

_Safely transfers `tokenId` token from `from` to `to`, checking first that contract recipients
are aware of the ERC721 protocol to prevent tokens from being forever locked.

`data` is additional data, it has no specified format and it is sent in call to `to`.

This internal function is equivalent to {safeTransferFrom}, and can be used to e.g.
implement alternative mechanisms to perform token transfer, such as signature-based.

Requirements:

- `from` cannot be the zero address.
- `to` cannot be the zero address.
- `tokenId` token must exist and be owned by `from`.
- If `to` refers to a smart contract, it must implement {IERC721Receiver-onERC721Received}, which is called upon a safe transfer.

Emits a {Transfer} event._

### _ownerOf

```solidity
function _ownerOf(uint256 tokenId) internal view virtual returns (address)
```

_Returns the owner of the `tokenId`. Does NOT revert if token doesn't exist_

### _exists

```solidity
function _exists(uint256 tokenId) internal view virtual returns (bool)
```

_Returns whether `tokenId` exists.

Tokens can be managed by their owner or approved accounts via {approve} or {setApprovalForAll}.

Tokens start existing when they are minted (`_mint`),
and stop existing when they are burned (`_burn`)._

### _isApprovedOrOwner

```solidity
function _isApprovedOrOwner(address spender, uint256 tokenId) internal view virtual returns (bool)
```

_Returns whether `spender` is allowed to manage `tokenId`.

Requirements:

- `tokenId` must exist._

### _safeMint

```solidity
function _safeMint(address to, uint256 tokenId) internal virtual
```

_Safely mints `tokenId` and transfers it to `to`.

Requirements:

- `tokenId` must not exist.
- If `to` refers to a smart contract, it must implement {IERC721Receiver-onERC721Received}, which is called upon a safe transfer.

Emits a {Transfer} event._

### _safeMint

```solidity
function _safeMint(address to, uint256 tokenId, bytes data) internal virtual
```

_Same as {xref-ERC721-_safeMint-address-uint256-}[`_safeMint`], with an additional `data` parameter which is
forwarded in {IERC721Receiver-onERC721Received} to contract recipients._

### _mint

```solidity
function _mint(address to, uint256 tokenId) internal virtual
```

_Mints `tokenId` and transfers it to `to`.

WARNING: Usage of this method is discouraged, use {_safeMint} whenever possible

Requirements:

- `tokenId` must not exist.
- `to` cannot be the zero address.

Emits a {Transfer} event._

### _burn

```solidity
function _burn(uint256 tokenId) internal virtual
```

_Destroys `tokenId`.
The approval is cleared when the token is burned.
This is an internal function that does not check if the sender is authorized to operate on the token.

Requirements:

- `tokenId` must exist.

Emits a {Transfer} event._

### _transfer

```solidity
function _transfer(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId) internal virtual
```

_Transfers `tokenId` from `from` to `to`.
 As opposed to {transferFrom}, this imposes no restrictions on msg.sender.

Requirements:

- `to` cannot be the zero address.
- `tokenId` token must be owned by `from`.

Emits a {Transfer} event._

### _approve

```solidity
function _approve(address to, uint256 tokenId) internal virtual
```

_Approve `to` to operate on `tokenId`

Emits an {Approval} event._

### _setApprovalForAll

```solidity
function _setApprovalForAll(address owner, address operator, bool approved) internal virtual
```

_Approve `operator` to operate on all of `owner` tokens

Emits an {ApprovalForAll} event._

### _requireMinted

```solidity
function _requireMinted(uint256 tokenId) internal view virtual
```

_Reverts if the `tokenId` has not been minted yet._

### _afterTokenTransfer

```solidity
function _afterTokenTransfer(address from, address to, uint256 firstTokenId, uint256 batchSize) internal virtual
```

_Hook that is called after any token transfer. This includes minting and burning. If {ERC721Consecutive} is
used, the hook may be called as part of a consecutive (batch) mint, as indicated by `batchSize` greater than 1.

Calling conditions:

- When `from` and `to` are both non-zero, ``from``'s tokens were transferred to `to`.
- When `from` is zero, the tokens were minted for `to`.
- When `to` is zero, ``from``'s tokens were burned.
- `from` and `to` are never both zero.
- `batchSize` is non-zero.

To learn more about hooks, head to xref:ROOT:extending-contracts.adoc#using-hooks[Using Hooks]._

### __unsafe_increaseBalance

```solidity
function __unsafe_increaseBalance(address account, uint256 amount) internal
```

_Unsafe write access to the balances, used by extensions that "mint" tokens using an {ownerOf} override.

WARNING: Anyone calling this MUST ensure that the balances remain consistent with the ownership. The invariant
being that for any address `a` the value returned by `balanceOf(a)` must be equal to the number of tokens such
that `ownerOf(tokenId)` is `a`._
